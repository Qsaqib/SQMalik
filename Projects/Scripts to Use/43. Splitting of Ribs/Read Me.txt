----- Final cutting the ribs.dyn

Using this script consist of two parts
1. Run The script for refined ribs. Since all the elements are not converted to solids 
 and only portion of it is comverted into solids we need to run the script the second time.
2. We delete the family that were used in the refined solids and re run the script for non refined solids.

After all the geometries has been converted to into famillies each of the family can be edited 
and all those extra lines and surfaces can be removed using void.



----- Final Surface Area of the ribs.dyn

--- This script is used to calculate the formwork of Ribs, in which the direction is not maintained uniformly.
--- This is a project based script BUT the methodology can be used for other cases as well.
