Using this script consist of two parts
1. Run The script for refined ribs. Since all the elements are not convereted to solids 
 and only portion of it is comverted into solids we need to run the script the second time.
2. We delete the family that were used in the refined solids and re run the script for non refined solids.

After all the geometries has been converted to into famillies each of the family can be edited 
and all those extra lines and surfaces can be removed using void.
