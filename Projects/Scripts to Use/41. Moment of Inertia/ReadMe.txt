Sectional Momnet of Inertia

---> This script get's you an approximated value of the sectional moment of Inertia. 
---> It uses Polygon method to find the Second moment of Inertia.
---> The accuracy of this script will increase with the increase in the number of mesh elements.
---> Limitation:
          --->  The mesh can't be manually controlled for the time being.
