We have two scripts to split Generic Model Elements into Pieces.

1. Horizontal ---> Here it means those elements That when split will strictly be splitted to two elements.
	      ---> These elements can be split using the Hosizontal script. Though  modification in the script is required 
              ---> as per the requirement
2. Circular   ---> Those elements That split in to more than two elements per split function.
	      ---> This script lets you split the elements as per the regrid placed and script needs to be modify to use it.
