There are 2 scripts for Clash Detection

1. Perform Clash detection inside Dynamo and have basic functionality of using it. This can be used to check if an element clashes
   with another one and parameters can be assigned to them based on this clash detection
2. The second script uses data from Naviswork and places the family ClashSphere on the clash points.
