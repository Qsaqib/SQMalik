1. Import ViewTemplates without loosing filter data
   - While importing viewtemplates, if the imported viewtemplate has the same filter name
     as the current document but with different value, the current filter will be applied.
     This script, basically renames the current viewtemplate and replaces it with a suffix 
     gives you the option to choose which filter to import and changes the filter name.
2. Deleting View filter
   - This allows to select filters to delete in one go.
